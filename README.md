# project2:
This project seeks to analyse the effectiveness of vaccines against the mortality rates of preventable diseases that have been common throughout human history. Particular emphasis will be given towards measles rates in the U.S., seeing that common trends/conspiracy theories have resulted in a reemergence of this disease that was previously thought to be eradicated.  

We hope to quantify the cumulative influence that vaccines have had on the prevalence of these diseases and what impact the recent lowering vacination rates have among the public's health.
